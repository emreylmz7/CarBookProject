## Implemented Design Patterns:

- **Onion Architecture**: This project adheres to the Onion Architecture, a modular architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns by organizing code into distinct layers: presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure. This approach promotes scalability, maintainability, and testability.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: CQRS segregates read and write operations, optimizing performance and scalability by allowing tailored data models and query optimizations for read operations.

- **Mediator Design Pattern**: Employing the Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling by centralizing communication between components, facilitating easier maintenance and extensibility.

- **Repository Pattern**: The Repository pattern abstracts data access, providing a clean separation between business logic and data access code, thus enhancing testability and flexibility in data storage choices.

## Utilized Technologies:

- **JWT (Json Web Token)**: JWT ensures secure authentication and authorization, enabling users to securely log in and access resources based on their roles and permissions.

- **SignalR**: SignalR powers real-time communication, enabling features like live notifications and instant updates between the server and clients, enhancing user experience.

- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: DTOs streamline data transfer between layers, reducing unnecessary data exposure and improving performance.

- **Fluent Validation**: Fluent Validation simplifies input validation by providing a fluent interface for defining validation rules, ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid data entry.

- **Identity**: ASP.NET Core Identity manages user authentication, authorization, and user account management, providing a robust and customizable solution for identity management.

- **Automapper**: Automapper simplifies object-to-object mapping, reducing manual mapping code and improving code maintainability and readability.
